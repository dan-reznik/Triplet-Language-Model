Departing from a corpus of text, build a table of unique 3-token sequences (w1,w2,w3), annotating each with the probability of w3, given (w1,w2). The novel utterance is a simple Markov-walk on this table, i.e., start with an initial (w1,w2). For all possible w3's that may follow, select one via an unfair RNG, weighted by the w3's probs. Repeat the process starting with (w2,w3), to produce a w4, etc. <b>note1:</b> that within a novel utterance, all sequential triples are guaranteed to have been penned by the original author, whereas the quadruples are not. <b>note2</b>: a novel utterance may contain less than max words in when the process hits a dead-end, i.e., for some (w1,w2) there is no w3 on the table of triples. This happens then a previous (w0,w1) produced a w2 such that the pair (w1,w2) comes from the end of a chapter.
